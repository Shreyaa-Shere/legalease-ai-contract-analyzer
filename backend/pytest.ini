# PyTest Configuration File
# This file tells pytest how to run tests for your Django project

# BEGINNER EXPLANATION:
# ---------------------
# This file configures pytest to work with Django.
# It tells pytest:
# - Where to find Django settings
# - Which files are test files
# - How to run tests

# Django settings module (tells pytest where Django settings are)
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = legalease.settings

# Python files that contain tests
# pytest will look for files matching these patterns:
python_files = tests.py test_*.py *_tests.py

# Python classes that contain tests
python_classes = Test*

# Python functions/methods that are tests
python_functions = test_*

# Where to look for test files
# . = current directory and subdirectories
testpaths = .

# Options for running tests
# -v = verbose (show more details)
# --tb=short = shorter traceback format
# --strict-markers = warn if using unknown markers
addopts = 
    -v
    --tb=short
    --strict-markers
    --reuse-db
    --nomigrations

# Markers (labels you can add to tests)
# Example: @pytest.mark.slow marks a test as slow
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
    unit: marks tests as unit tests
